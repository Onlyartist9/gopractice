# Navigating the Robot

This was a project I had been assigned during my Computer Networking course in uni. While the expectation was that one make use of either C++ or Python. I decided to use Go as a way through which I could learn the language. Learned quite a bit to say the least.


To run this code for yourself: 

1. navigate to the **tcpserver.go** file and use the `go run tcpserver.go` command in the command shell.
2. navigate to the **tester** folder and execute the tester binary this way tester <port number> <address> [number of test(s)].

By default the port number is 8000 and the address is localhost. There are a total of 30 tests.
