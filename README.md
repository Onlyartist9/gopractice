# Navigating the Robot

To run this code for yourself: 

1. navigate to the **tcpserver.go** file and use the `go run tcpserver.go` command in the command shell.
2. navigate to the **tester** folder and execute the tester binary this way `./tester [port number] [address] [number of test(s)]`.

By default the port number is 8000 and the address is "localhost". There are a total of 30 tests. To simply run all tests one just runs this way: `./tester [port number] [address]`.
